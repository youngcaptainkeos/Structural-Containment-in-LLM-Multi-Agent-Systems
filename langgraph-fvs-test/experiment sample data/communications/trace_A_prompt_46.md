- **Executive Strategy** (Path: Research Analyst → Research Writer → Engineering Planner → Engineering Developer → Engineering QA → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Executive Strategy)

### 🛡️ Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) Containment
- **FVS Nodes Selected**: Engineering Developer, Research Reviewer, Executive Supervisor
- **Containment Ratio**: 84.6%
- **Containment Gain**: 11 agents contained.
- **Propagation Depth**: Reduced from 7 to 2 hops.
- **Affected Departments**: Reduced from 3 to 2 departments.
Partial containment was achieved. Compromise propagation was significantly limited.
